# Understanding npm and Alternatives

This guide explains what **npm** is, how it's used, and introduces alternatives like **Yarn**, **pnpm**, and **bun** for managing JavaScript/Node.js project dependencies.

---

## 🔹 What is npm?

**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**.  
It’s the default package manager that comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages.

### ✅ Key Uses:
- Install packages (like React, Express, etc.)
- Manage dependencies
- Run scripts for development and builds

### 📁 Example Commands:
```bash
npm install react             # Installs React
npm install                   # Installs all dependencies listed in package.json
npm run start                 # Runs a custom script (e.g., dev server)
npm update                    # Updates installed packages
```

---

## 📄 How npm Works

* Uses a `package.json` file to keep track of project info and dependencies.
* Stores libraries inside the `node_modules/` folder.
* Can run scripts (defined in `package.json`) like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

## 🔄 Alternatives to npm

Here are some popular alternatives to npm that serve similar purposes but with different performance or features.

### 1. 🧶 Yarn

* Developed by Facebook.
* Faster installs and better dependency resolution than older versions of npm.
* Uses a `yarn.lock` file instead of `package-lock.json`.

```bash
yarn add react
yarn install
yarn start
```

---

### 2. 🟡 pnpm

* Performance-focused package manager.
* Uses a global content-addressable storage to reduce disk usage.
* Great for monorepos.

```bash
pnpm add react
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

---

### 3. ⚡ bun

* All-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager.
* Extremely fast. Also includes a bundler, test runner, and transpiler.
* Still newer and evolving.

```bash
bun add react
bun install
bun run start
```
